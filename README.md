# Updates

## Harcourt

- Migrated DB from MSSQL Server to MySQL, added a script file under db/mysql to create the DB. There is an automated tool you can use to migrate DB's however I was unable to get it working so I did it by hand. I modified the database some if you want to revert to the older database we can do that just let me know.

- We probably need to update the project backlog as we're now a member short and a lot of requirements have changed.
